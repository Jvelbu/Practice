ANOVA Model: Â Used electricity usage (kWh) as the DV and season as the IV in an ANOVA.
Result: There is no discernible variation in electricity use across seasons, as indicated by the p-value of 0.561.
Interpretation: The null hypothesis cannot be rejected because the p-value is higher than 0.05. There is no proof that the season has a major impact on electricity use.
Comparisons after the fact (optional): Tukey's HSD test can reveal particular pairwise comparisons between seasons if post-hoc testing are conducted in spite of the non-significant ANOVA result. However, it is doubtful that there will be significant changes between pairings of seasons because the overall ANOVA was not significant.
Results Graph: To see the distribution of electricity use by season, you can make a boxplot. This makes the dispersion and possible outliers easier to see.
Presenting the Findings:
Levene's Test: The assumption of homogeneity of variances was satisfied since the variances between the groups were homogeneous (p = 0.8697).
ANOVA: There was no discernible variation in electricity consumption by season (p = 0.561).
Post-Hoc (not required): When the ANOVA result is not significant, Tukey's HSD is usually not required, but it may shed light on particular group comparisons.
